## Abstract

Invasive witches have become a management concern at Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge. As such, there is a need to estimate witch occurrence within the Refuge.

## Keywords

Halloween, occupancy, Witches

######## 

<br><br><br>

# Study Area

We surveyed for witches at Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska. blah blah


# Methods

### Data Collection

We visited a sample randomly distributed sites across Tetlin Refuge. At each site, we spent one hour looking and listening for witches. We revisited each site eight times.

### Model

We estimated witch occupancy and detection using a single-season occupancy model. We used the `unmarked` R package. [blah, blah, blah]


# Results

## Results

We surveyed a total of `r nrow(dat)` sites. The average distance to water at our sites was `r round(mean(dat$water), 2)` m. The average distance to forest at our sites was `r round(mean(dat$forest), 2)` m.

![](../../images/base_map.png "Title: A map of the sites surveyed for witches, Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska."){width="50%"}

We observed witches on `r sum(dat[6:13])` of 800 site visits, for a naive occupancy of `r round(sum(dat[6:13])/ncell(dat[6:13]), 2)`. 

```{r plot-psi}
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-cap: Occupancy of witches at Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, 2024.

# Calculate predicted values (unscaled)
pred <- rbind(plotEffectsData(mod, "state", "forest"), plotEffectsData(mod, "state", "water")) %>%
  mutate(covariateValue = case_when(
    covariate == "forest" ~ covariateValue * attr(sc, 'scaled:scale')[[1]] + attr(sc, 'scaled:center')[[1]],
    covariate == "water" ~ covariateValue * attr(sc, 'scaled:scale')[[2]] + attr(sc, 'scaled:center')[[2]]
  ))

# Plot predicted values (psi)
ggplot(pred, aes(x = covariateValue, y = Predicted), 
  group = covariate) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), 
              linetype = 2, 
              alpha = 0.1) +
  xlab("Distance (m)") +
  ylab("Psi") +
  facet_grid(~covariate, scales = "free")
```


# Discussion

## Adding citations and bibliography

Link a `.bib` document via the YAML header, and the bibliogaphy will be printed at the very end (as usual). The default bibliography style is provided in the `the-journal-of-wildlife-management.csl` file, which adopts the [Journal of Wildlife Management](https://www.nacwg.org/JWMguidelines2011.pdf) reference style.

References can be cited directly within the document using the R Markdown equivalent of the LaTeX citation system `[@key]`, where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry in the .bib file. Example: \[\@fws2001\]. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons (e.g., [@paul2009; @buckland1997]).

If you are using the reference manager [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (**highly recommended**), then Rstudio can [access your reference library directly](https://bookdown.org/pdr_higgins/rmrwr/adding-citations-to-your-rmarkdown.html). Zotero is available through FWS Apps-2-Go. There is also the package [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr). *citr* provides functions and an RStudio add-in to search a BibTeX-file to create and insert formatted Markdown citations into the current document.
